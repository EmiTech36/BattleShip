	 * The BattleshipGame class is the “main” class -- that is, it contains a main method. In this class you will set up the game; 
	 * accept ”shots” from the user; display the results; and print final scores. All input/output is done here (although some of 
	 * it is done by calling a print() method in the Ocean class.) All computation will be done in the Ocean class and the various Ship classes.
	 * To aid the user, row numbers should be displayed along the left edge of the array, and column numbers should be displayed along the top. 
	 * Numbers should be 0 to 9, not 1 to 10. The top left corner square should be 0, 0. Use different characters to indicate locations that contain a hit, 
	 * locations that contain a miss, and locations that have never been fired upon.
